### Heyyoooo, I am totoroot on GitHub! ðŸŒ¿

I endorse Free and Open Source Software and generally prefer [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) to GitHub, so some of my repositories on GitHub are only mirrors of the corresponding repositories on Codeberg which are synced once per day.

If you want to see the latest commits of these repositories, please [click here](https://codeberg.org/totoroot/) to go to my profile there.

If you like what I do, you can take a look at some project write-ups I do unregularly on [my blog](https://blog.thym.at).

In case you want to get in touch with me regrarding professional opportunities, please use the Email address on [my online resume](https://matthias.thym.at) to contact me.

If you have questions about any of my projects, please feel free to get in touch using my commit Email address on my profile page or open an issue in the corresponding repository.

You can also find me [in the Fediverse on Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@totoroot) and get in touch with me there:

Cheers,<br>
Matthias
